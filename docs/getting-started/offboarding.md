The offboarding process of AI-LAB is important for promoting responsible usage, maintaining data privacy and security, and managing resources effectively to provide a seamless user experience.

#### Clean up after use
AI-LAB encourages responsible usage, which includes cleaning up your user directory for files that are no longer needed. Let's take a moment to tidy up the files associated with this "Getting Started" tutorial (*...if you no longer need the files*).

```console
rm tensorflow_24.03-tf2-py3.sif
rm benchmark_tensorflow.py
```

Before deleting files, remember that you can [transfer files](/getting-started/file-management) from your AI-LAB directory to your local computer.

!!! warning "Deletion of data at 1. August"
    Every year at 1. August, all data and user information will be automatically removed from the AI-LAB platform. You will receive email notifications 2 months, 1 month, 14 days, and 2 day prior to the deletion date. It is important to ensure that you transfer any desired files from AI-LAB to your local computer before the deletion date.

!!! info "Apply for extension"
    Should you wish to keep your data on AI-LAB and use the platform for another semester, you can submit an extension request through the [application form](https://forms.office.com/e/caEhCRmqVN) for AI-LAB. Alternatively, you can apply for a new project.
